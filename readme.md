# Anonymous Swarm

Academics tend to privatize forms of freedom, which are the ecologies of 
knowledge. The goal of this project is to set up autonomous monitoring 
agents to systematically discover and confute the claims made by 
academics whose theories fall radically out of sort with the commons.

## Notes

The Periodic Table of Information will require samples of propositional 
forms in order to derive semantic models from which to check the 
inconsistency between folk psychology, as best as our understanding 
exemplifies, and academic psychology, as informed by the Language of 
Thought hypothesis and various other academic milieu which is realized 
in public research. Our hope is that we may determine how far Academics 
like Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett, et al. are abusing expectations of
people given lifeways of the commons, which must be protected from 
"the spirit of abstraction" (Gabriel Marcel) and "technocratic delirium"
(Dwayne Tunstall), largely continually re-founded in the research of
"propositional attitude psychology."
